# Customer_Analysis
In the customer analysis project, I harnessed the power of Tableau to conduct an in-depth exploration of customer data, extracting valuable insights to enhance business strategies and customer engagement. The project's primary objective was to gain a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior, preferences, and trends. This was done by importing an excel dataset into Tableau and visualizing it through various charts. These charts were combined to create a fully dynamic dashboard that can be customized based on criteria of the user's choice.
